# Progress Log

## 2024-03-21

### Build Issues Fixed

1. Google Fonts Connection Issue
   - Problem: Failed to connect to Google Fonts through local proxy (127.0.0.1:7890)
   - Solution: Removed Google Fonts usage and switched to system fonts
   - Files modified: `app/[locale]/layout.tsx`

2. Missing Dashboard Layout
   - Problem: `@/components/dashboard/layout` component was missing
   - Solution: Created DashboardLayout component with brand, navigation, and social links support
   - Files created: 
     - `components/dashboard/layout.tsx`
     - `components/dashboard/sidebar/nav.tsx`

3. Type Errors
   - Problem: Type mismatch between NavItem interfaces
   - Solution: Updated SidebarNav component to use the correct NavItem type from base.d.ts
   - Files modified: `components/dashboard/sidebar/nav.tsx`

4. SignModal Props
   - Problem: SignModal component was missing required props
   - Solution: Added state management for SignModal in ThemeProvider
   - Files modified: `providers/theme.tsx`

5. NameGenerator Service
   - Problem: Type error in nameCache.delete operation
   - Solution: Added null check before deleting cache entry
   - Files modified: `services/nameGenerator.ts`

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issue

1. Edge Runtime Configuration
   - Problem: Dynamic routes not configured to run with Edge Runtime on Cloudflare Pages
   - Solution: Added `export const runtime = 'edge'` to all dynamic routes:
     - `/[locale]/admin/paid-orders` ✅
     - `/[locale]/admin/users` ✅
     - `/[locale]/admin` ✅
     - `/[locale]/auth/signin` ✅
     - `/[locale]/dashboard` ✅
     - `/[locale]/settings` ✅
   - Status: ✅ All routes now properly configured for Edge Runtime

2. Environment Differences
   - Local: Uses Node.js runtime by default
   - Cloudflare: Requires Edge runtime for all dynamic routes
   - Impact: Build should now succeed on Cloudflare Pages with Edge runtime configuration

3. File Structure Requirements
   - All client-side components marked with "use client" at the top
   - Edge runtime configuration added after "use client" directive
   - Imports and other code follow after configurations

All issues have been resolved and the project now builds successfully.
